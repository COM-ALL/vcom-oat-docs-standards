# Separators & Casing 

Guiding Principle: consistency across platforms

1. Path/URL‑sensitive surfaces (GitHub repo names, folders, file names): kebab-case (lowercase with -)
2. Display surfaces (Teams names, Power BI workspaces, Power Automate flows, Power Platform environment display names): Title Case with | (pipe) as section divider
3. Dataverse logical/schema names: lower_snake_case with a publisher prefix (e.g., vcom_)
