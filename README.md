# VCOM OAT Data Standards

This repository houses the foundational data standards for the Naresh K. Vashisht College of Medicine (VCOM) Office of Academic Technology (OAT) at Texas A&M University.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to create a unified, cross-platform naming and data management standard spanning:
- GitHub repositories
- SharePoint folder structures
- File naming conventions
- Power Platform environments, solutions, tables, dataflows
- Power Automate flows
- Power BI workspaces and artifacts
- Microsoft Teams naming conventions

These standards support the broader OAT initiative to standardize data across seven domains:
- VCAT — Course Management
- VSTU — Student Management
- VENROLL — Enrollment Management
- VEVAL — Evaluation Management
- VDATA — Data Management
- VSITE — Site Management
- VFACU — Faculty Management

## Systems in Scope
The following systems are part of the data workflow and require coordinated naming and organizational standards:
- TBANNER — Banner/Compass
- VELENTRA — Elentra
- VPIQ — Progress IQ
- VFACPORT — Faculty Portal

## Repository Structure
Suggested layout:

```
/standards/
  00-introduction.md
  01-naming-conventions.md
  02-data-formats.md
  03-security-and-classification.md
  04-versioning-and-releases.md
  05-quality-and-testing.md
/examples/
/glossary/
README.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
```

## Guiding Principles
- Consistency across platforms
- Machine readability (sortable, parseable)
- Human readability (clear intent, predictable structure)
- Scalable for automation and future system integrations
- Domain- and system-aware naming tokens

## Contributing
Updates to standards require a pull request and review by OAT leadership or designated maintainers.
