# Microsoft Teams (teams & channels)

## Team Name (maps to M365 Group):

```
VCOM OAT | <Domain or Program> | <Purpose> | <Sensitivity?>
# Example: VCOM OAT | VDATA | Engineering | Internal
```

## Standard channels:

* 00‑announcements (pinned)
* 01‑general
* 02‑design
* 03‑build
* 04‑run
* 99‑archive

Private channels: suffix with ‑private (e.g., leadership‑private)

Keep Team names concise to avoid exceeding mail nickname length; the pattern above is safe.
