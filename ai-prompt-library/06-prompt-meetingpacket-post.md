# MEETING PACKET

Prompt:

```
“Using the full meeting transcript I provide, create a comprehensive meeting packet consisting of:
SECTION 1 — MEETING RECAP SUMMARY
Produce a concise, context‑preserving summary that includes:
1. Key Takeaways

* Identify 5–8 major themes that emerged during the meeting.
* Preserve the meaning and strategic context of the discussion, not just the surface‑level points.
* Make each takeaway 2–4 sentences.

2. Action Items (Recap Style)
Each action item must include:

* Owners 
* Clear, concise action statement
* One–two sentences of contextual detail describing why the action matters
* Only use details supported directly by the transcript. 
* Keep the recap clean, precise, and leadership‑ready.

SECTION 2 — CURATED DETAILS PAGE
Generate a complete curated details page using the following structure:
1. Page Title -Format as:YYYY‑MM‑DD [Meeting Title in Title Case]
2. Topic Index -Identify all major themes from the transcript. -List topics as simple headings (Loop will convert to anchors automatically).
3. Speaker Index -List each speaker with a brief (1 sentence) description capturing:
* What they contributed
* Their domain or emphasis
* Their context in the discussion
4. Loop‑Optimized Collapsible Sections
For each topic identified: 
* Create an H2 heading (## Topic Name) suitable for Loop collapsible formatting
* Under each section, include curated quotes: Use only quotes that preserve meaning, nuance, and context
* Attribute each quote with the speaker's name
* Avoid redundancy
* Present quotes in blockquote style
* Include source references if provided
5. Timestamp Map
For every curated quote:
* Organize by topic
* List each curated quote as a bullet in the format: [HH:MM–HH:MM] Speaker — “Quote…”
* If the transcript uses blocks or internal IDs, infer approximate timestamps from the transcript’s metadata.

SECTION 3 — LOOP‑READY TASK LIST
Generate a Task List formatted specifically for Microsoft Loop, ready for copy/paste.
Requirements:

* Use - [ ] to initiate each task (Loop auto‑converts this to task cards)
* Include: Task title (bold)
* Owners
* Details (one sentence; concise and actionable)
* Only include tasks that are explicitly supported by the transcript
* Use the following template for each task: 
- [ ] **Task Title**
  **Owner(s):**
  **Details:**
* Do not add due dates, tags, or assignments — I will do that inside Loop.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE ENTIRE PACKET
* Do not fabricate any information. Use only what is present in the transcript.
* Preserve the original intent, nuance, and context of all statements.
* Keep formatting clean and Loop‑friendly.
* Ensure each section is clearly separated with headings.
